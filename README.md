# Ethical Hacking Technical Report

**Client:** CornHub RED  
**Date:** May 11, 2024  
**Prepared by:** John Roger Argarin and Jan Fredriz Paje  

## Executive Summary

This report presents the technical findings of the ethical hacking assessment conducted for [Company Name or Website]. The assessment aimed to identify vulnerabilities within the organization's network infrastructure, applications, and systems. Through various testing methodologies, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, critical and high-risk issues were discovered. This report provides detailed descriptions of these findings, along with actionable recommendations for remediation.

## Vulnerability Summary

1. **Network Infrastructure:**
   - **Critical:** Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-XXXX-XXXX) in the Apache Struts framework (version X.X.X) running on [Server Name], allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely.
   - **High:** Misconfigured firewall rules permitting unrestricted access from external IP ranges to sensitive internal services (e.g., SSH, RDP) on [Server IP/Hostname].

2. **Web Applications:**
   - **Critical:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the login form of [Application Name], potentially enabling an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database.
   - **High:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in [Application Name], allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.

3. **Operating Systems:**
   - **Critical:** Outdated and unpatched operating systems (Windows Server 2008 R2) on critical servers [Server Names], exposing them to known exploits and malware.
   - **High:** Weak password policies on domain user accounts, facilitating brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.

4. **Wireless Networks:**
   - **Critical:** Weak encryption (WEP) used in wireless networks, allowing attackers to intercept and decrypt wireless traffic, exposing sensitive data.

5. **Social Engineering:**
   - **High:** Several employees fell victim to phishing emails, providing credentials and sensitive information in response.

6. **Database Security:**
   - **Critical:** Unencrypted database backups stored on a publicly accessible server, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access.

7. **Endpoint Security:**
   - **High:** Lack of endpoint security controls such as antivirus software and host intrusion detection systems, leaving endpoints vulnerable to malware infections and unauthorized access.

8. **Authentication Mechanisms:**
   - **High:** Weak or default credentials used for administrative accounts, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to critical systems and data.

9. **Physical Security:**
   - **High:** Lack of physical access controls, such as badge authentication or surveillance cameras, in data centers and server rooms, posing a risk of unauthorized access and tampering.

10. **Application Security:**
    - **High:** Lack of input validation in file upload functionality of [Application Name], allowing attackers to upload and execute malicious files on the server.

## Recommendations

1. **Network Infrastructure:**
   - Immediately patch Apache Struts to the latest version to mitigate the Remote Code Execution vulnerability.
   - Review and update firewall rules to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.

2. **Web Applications:**
   - Conduct a thorough code review and implement input validation to prevent SQL Injection and XSS attacks.
   - Implement security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy) to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.

3. **Operating Systems:**
   - Develop a patch management process to regularly update and secure operating systems against known vulnerabilities.
   - Enforce strong password policies and consider implementing multi-factor authentication for domain user accounts.

4. **Wireless Networks:**
   - Upgrade wireless network encryption to WPA2 or WPA3 to ensure confidentiality and integrity of wireless communications.

5. **Social Engineering:**
   - Conduct regular security awareness training for employees to educate them about the risks of phishing attacks and how to identify and report suspicious emails.

6. **Database Security:**
   - Encrypt database backups before storing them on any server, especially if they are accessible from the internet.

7. **Endpoint Security:**
   - Implement antivirus software and host intrusion detection systems on all endpoints to detect and prevent malware infections.

8. **Authentication Mechanisms:**
   - Enforce strong password policies and use complex, unique passwords for administrative accounts.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication for all privileged accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

9. **Physical Security:**
   - Implement access controls such as badge authentication and surveillance cameras in data centers and server rooms to monitor and restrict access.

10. **Application Security:**
    - Implement file type verification and validation for uploaded files to prevent execution of malicious files on the server.

## Conclusion

The findings of the ethical hacking assessment highlight several critical vulnerabilities and security weaknesses within XYZ Corporation's infrastructure and applications. By implementing the recommended remediation measures, XYZ Corporation can significantly enhance its security posture and mitigate the risk of cyber threats and data breaches.
